Project Name: Box Love

Description:
Box Love is a web application designed to simulate a digital version of the classic "love meter" game using modern web technologies. The project was built using HTML, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and React for frontend development.

Key Features Implemented:

User Interface: Developed a responsive and visually appealing UI using HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.
Algorithm Integration: Implemented a custom algorithm in JavaScript to calculate and display a "love score" based on user inputs, mimicking the traditional love meter concept.
Interactive Elements: Incorporated interactive elements using React components to enhance user engagement and provide real-time updates of the love score as inputs change.
LocalStorage: Utilized browser's LocalStorage API to store user inputs temporarily, enabling a seamless user experience without data loss during session refreshes.
Deployment: Deployed the application using [mention deployment platform], ensuring accessibility and usability across different browsers.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React
Version Control: Git, GitHub for project repository management
Deployment: [Deployment platform/service]
Outcome:
